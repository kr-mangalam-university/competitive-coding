# Practice Questions

Welcome to the Practice Questions section of the KR Mangalam University Competitive Coding Repository! This section is dedicated to providing practice problems covering various topics in computer science and programming.

## About This Section

The Practice Questions section contains a diverse range of problems designed to help you improve your problem-solving abilities, algorithmic thinking, and programming skills. The problems cover a number of topics such as data structures, algorithms, and more. Additionally, you'll find industry-asked questions commonly encountered in technical interviews, presented in Jupyter Notebook format.

## How to Use

1. **Explore the Problems**: Browse through the collection of practice problems to find ones that match your skill level and interests. Each problem is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing a detailed description of the problem statement, input/output format, and sample test cases. You can view jupyter notebooks online here - [https://kokes.github.io/nbviewer.js/viewer.html]('https://kokes.github.io/nbviewer.js/viewer.html')
2. **Solve the Problems**: Attempt to solve the problems on your own. You may use the provided code cells to write and test your solutions.
3. **Review Solutions**: After attempting a problem, review the provided solutions within the Jupyter Notebook. Compare your approach with the provided solutions to gain insights into different problem-solving strategies and techniques.
4. **Prepare for Interviews**: Practice solving industry-asked questions presented in Jupyter Notebooks to prepare for technical interviews. Use the interactive environment to simulate real-world interview scenarios and hone your problem-solving skills under time constraints.

Happy Coding and Learning! ðŸš€
